# 💫 About Me:
+ 🧑🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m @chaselikethebank<br>+ 🚀 I’m interested in all things tech, entrepreneurship, and triathlon.<br>+ 🌱 I’m currently a fullstack developer durring the day, I mentor inspired young devs as a prof at night, and a musician on the weekend. <br>+ 👽 I’m am always building something.<br>+ 📫 I ltry and becareful w what I get good at. <br>
# 💻 Stack:
I like Rails and Laravel and tend to go there for MVPs and smaller team projects. I end up working in .NET in larger conservative builds. I'm excited to do more with fewer frontend frameworks and explore this new HTMX paradigm. 
# ⌚ Next Steps:
I am currently spending a lot on cloud deployments, so, I am learning more about servers, firewalls and self-hosting in general.
