# 💫 About Me
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m @chaselikethebank  
- 🚀 I’m passionate about tech, entrepreneurship, and triathlon  
- 🌱 By day, I’m a full-stack developer; by night, a mentor and professor; and on weekends, a musician  
- 👽 I’m always building something  
- 📫 I try to be careful what I get good at  

# 💻 Tech Stack
I like **MERN, Rails, and Laravel** for MVPs, microservices, or smaller teams.  
In larger conservative builds, I often end up working in **.NET**.  
Lately, I’m excited about **SQLite**—over 1B deployments to date 🚀  

# ⌚ Current Step
Working on **cloud deployment**: servers, firewalls, and cost management.

# 🚀 Thought:
Nav menus and chatbots are antithetical to each other.
